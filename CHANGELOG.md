## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes

#### Section Component Redesign
The Section component now has a two-layer architecture for more powerful layout control:

- **Section layer** (outer, full-width): Controls the full-bleed background, border, padding, and margin
- **Content layer** (inner, constrained): Controls the content area with max-width, background, border, and padding

**Field renames:**
- `background` → `sectionBackground`
- `border` → `sectionBorder`
- `customPadding` → `sectionPadding`
- `margin` → `sectionMargin`

**New fields:**
- `contentDimensions` - Max-width, min-height for content area (default: 1200px centered)
- `contentBackground` - Background for the content area
- `contentBorder` - Border around the content area
- `contentPadding` - Padding inside the content area

**Removed fields:**
- `fullWidth` - No longer needed; set `contentDimensions` to full width instead

#### Container Component Simplified
The Container component has been simplified to a single-layer organizational wrapper:

**Removed fields:**
- `innerBackground` - Use Section for two-layer backgrounds
- `innerBorder` - Use Section for two-layer borders
- `innerPadding` - Now just `padding`

**Migration:** If you were using Container's inner/outer backgrounds, migrate to Section which now provides this functionality with clearer naming.

### Added

- Changelog file to track breaking changes and new features

### Fixed

- Slot/DropZone now expands to fill container's minHeight in the editor
- RichText component now fills available width (removed Tailwind prose max-width constraint)
- Removed hardcoded padding defaults across components; now properly set via defaultProps

### Changed

- Section component now provides full-bleed background with constrained content area out of the box
- Container component simplified for basic organizational use cases
- Better field grouping in the editor panel (Section styling → Content styling)
- Default content area max-width of 1200px makes the two-layer design immediately visible
